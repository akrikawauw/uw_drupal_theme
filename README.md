This is a port of the (new) [UW WordPress Theme](https://github.com/uweb/uw_wp_theme) which utilizes Bootstrap 4 built by the UMAC web team.

**Note:** This is currently a Work-In-Progress project and **not at all ready for production**. We've put it up on github to enable collaboration. When we feel it's ready, we'll give it a tag.

2. Install and enable this theme (download and extract to your /themes/custom directory).
